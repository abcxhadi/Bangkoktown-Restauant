Here is the code for the "Ready to taste Authentic Thailand?" container:

```jsx
<div className="relative group">
  <div className="absolute -inset-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-red-600/40 via-amber-600/40 to-red-600/40 rounded-3xl blur-2xl opacity-60 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-500"></div>
  <div className="relative bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900/80 to-black/80 backdrop-blur-xl p-16 rounded-3xl border border-gray-700/50 text-center">
    <h3 className="netflix-subheading text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-6 text-white">
      Ready to Taste Authentic Thailand?
    </h3>
    <p className="netflix-body text-gray-300 text-xl max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-12 font-light leading-relaxed">

    </p>
    <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-6 justify-center">
      {/* You can place your buttons or other content here */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### How it Works:

*   **Outer `div` (The Glow Effect):**
    *   `relative group`: This is the main container and is set to `relative` to position the glow effect inside it. The `group` class is used to trigger the hover effect on the inner glow `div`.
    *   `absolute -inset-1`: This creates a pseudo-element that is slightly larger than the parent container.
    *   `bg-gradient-to-r from-red-600/40 via-amber-600/40 to-red-600/40`: This creates the gradient for the glow.
    *   `rounded-3xl blur-2xl`: This rounds the corners and applies a heavy blur to create the soft glow effect.
    *   `opacity-60 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-500`: The glow is semi-transparent by default and becomes fully opaque on hover, with a smooth transition.

*   **Inner `div` (The Content Container):
    *   `relative`: This ensures the content appears on top of the glow effect.
    *   `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900/80 to-black/80`: This creates a subtle gradient for the container background.
    *   `backdrop-blur-xl`: This applies a glassmorphism effect, blurring the background behind the container.
    *   `p-16 rounded-3xl border border-gray-700/50`: This adds padding, rounds the corners, and adds a subtle border.

This combination of a blurred gradient glow and a semi-transparent, blurred content container creates a sophisticated and visually appealing effect that is consistent with the premium aesthetic of your website.
